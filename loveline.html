                      <p>Less than a year after we first met, we flew to Prague to celebrate Josef's graduation and spend time with his family. Then we did a week of traveling - espressos in Vienna, paella in Barcelona, and homemade sangria in Mallorca!

                  <div class="box-content">
                      <p>We were visiting Josef's family for Christmas, so we held our own mini-Christmas the weekend before we left.</p>

                      <p>Josef wrapped each of my Christmas pesents with a small drawing and meaning behind the gift. The last gift was a beautiful ring that I love almost as much as I love him.</p>
